	<p>After the Great War Germany went into an economic depression. This was caused by the stock market crash and the Treaty of Versailles taking the colonies and industrial capital of Germany. A group was formed during this time named the German Workers Party, this party aimed to eliminate the marxism of the free trade unions and make germany a nationalist country. Hitler joined the group and became popular in it because of his ideas and extreme nationalism. He soon got promoted to the spokesman of the group and gained enough power to take over the group and rename it to the National Socialist German Workers Party. He then gained power through his nationalism, use of propaganda, and persecution of jews to unite his party.</p>
