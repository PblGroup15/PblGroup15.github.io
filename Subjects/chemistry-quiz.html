		 ["A group was formed during this time named the German Workers Party, this party aimed to eliminate the marxism of the free trade unions and make Germany a nationalist country. Hitler joined the group and became popular in it because of his ideas and extreme nationalism. He soon got promoted to the spokesman of the group and gained enough power to take over the group and rename it to the National Socialist German Workers Party. He then gained power through his nationalism, use of propaganda, and persecution of jews to unite his party."],

He decided to disregard the agreement and conquer all of Czechoslovakia anyway."],

		 ["The battle of Stalingrad was important because the last of the nazi got taken down there in the Russian winter after the huge soviet counter-attack."],
		 ["After WWII the cold war occurred which was called the cold war because there was no direct conflict in the war like traditional wars. This cold war was the US against the USSR. The US fought for capitalism and the soviets for communism. They fought many proxy war which were small wars in different countries that the bigger countries set it up, but don't directly participate in."],
		 ["Salt 1 and Salt 2 were two documents that America and the USSR signed to stop building nuclear fire arms."],
