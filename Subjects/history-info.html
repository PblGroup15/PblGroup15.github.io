	<h3>Pre World War II</h3>
	<!- Body for topic 1 ->
	<p>After the Great War Germany went into an economic depression. This was caused by the stock market crash and the Treaty of Versailles taking the colonies and industrial capital of Germany. A group was formed during this time named the German Workers Party, this party aimed to eliminate the marxism of the free trade unions and make germany a nationalist country. Hitler joined the group and became popular in it because of his ideas and extreme nationalism. He soon got promoted to the spokesman of the group and gained enough power to take over the group and rename it to the National Socialist German Workers Party. He then gained power through his nationalism, use of propaganda, and persecution of jews to unite his party.

        Hitler had people he called brown shirts that were part of the party riot at other meetings that opposed his views. He then got confident enough to attempt to conquer the bavarian government with 3000 nazi members. Hitler failed his conquer with 16 members dead and he being thrown in jail for treason for 5 years. There in jail he wrote his book “mein kampf” which was about his struggle with the jews, how german people were the superior race of human, and his future plans for germany. After he got out of jail he ran for president making a nazi party. He made high energy speeches talking about his plans for germany to get back their land they lost in WWI, getting rid of the jews, and being extremely nationalist for german people. He did not become president but he had the biggest political party in germany. Hitler then got promoted to chancellor by Hindenburg. This gave him the power he needed to take germany. Hindenburg soon died and hitler promoted himself to leader which was president and chancellor wrapped into one. Hitler gained more power through the years as leader and started gathering troops. He then invaded Rhineland, the industrial capital of germany that was taken with the treaty of versailles. He captured it and started creating more military products.

	After hitler had enough armory and a big enough army he wanted to conquer Austria, but Austria surrendered and hitler took over their land. Hitler set his sights on Sudetenland and promised to the British Prime Minister that it would be his last conquer. They signed a peace agreement named the Munich agreement giving germany the land if they promised to not take any more land. Hitler agreed to this, but that wasn’t the end to his rapid conquering. He decided to disregard the agreement and conquer all of Czechoslovakia anyway. Hitler then gathered his troops to invade Poland. He quickly beat the polish army and Britain declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.

	<h3>World War II</h3>
	<!- Body for topic 2 ->
	<p>Germany occupied Poland to get closer to russia while the Soviet union invaded on the eastern front. (https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005070). Germany invaded to conquer poland and get closer to russia which they wanted to conquer. Russia invaded to keep germany from getting closer to them. Germany then went on to take Western Europe which included France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. Belgium and the Netherlands soon surrendered and the german attack pushed through luxembourg to get to france. Britain attacked germany in france at dunkirk. Germany won the battle because of the allies retreat to britain. 
	Shortly after this battle the US got bombed by Japan on Pearl Harbor which was a naval base in Hawaii. The US got a declaration of war to go to war with Japan in December 8, 1941 only 1 day after the attack. The Japanese invaded into the philippines and singapore. Shortly after the invasions the battle of the java sea occured. The battle of the Java sea was a big defeat for the allies. This battle was fought in the java sea between java and kalimantan. Battle of the Coral Sea was fought between Australia and New Guinea. This battle was in 1942 and was fought between Japan vs the US and Australia. The allies won the battle of the Coral Sea. The Battle of Midway was fought in Midway Island in 1942. It was Japan vs the US in which the US won.
	Nazi Germany invaded russia in the battle of stalingrad in which the nazi’s lost due to smart planning and a giant counter attack on the nazis involving nearly 1,000,000 soldiers. The last of the Nazi’s fell in that battle and that was the beginning of the end for them. D-Day occured which was the allies taking back france and eventually western europe from Nazi control. Adolf Hitler commited suicide and Nazi Germany surrendered and lost the war. Nazi Germany lost World War II because of many military mistakes that hitler made as well as their disadvantages in resources. One of the mistakes that hitler made was believing that he could take down countries with bigger industrial production. This thought may have been caused by hitler’s early wins against countries unprepared for war such as the area of Rhineland and Czechoslovakia. Germany also lost important battles such as the battle of Stalingrad.
