	<h3>Pre World War II</h3>
	<!- Body for topic 1 ->
	<p>After the Great War Germany went into an economic depression. This was caused by the stock market crash and the Treaty of Versailles taking the colonies and industrial capital of Germany. A group was formed during this time named the German Workers Party, this party aimed to eliminate the marxism of the free trade unions and make germany a nationalist country. Hitler joined the group and became popular in it because of his ideas and extreme nationalism. He soon got promoted to the spokesman of the group and gained enough power to take over the group and rename it to the National Socialist German Workers Party. He then gained power through his nationalism, use of propaganda, and persecution of jews to unite his party.

        Hitler had people he called brown shirts that were part of the party riot at other meetings that opposed his views. He then got confident enough to attempt to conquer the bavarian government with 3000 nazi members. Hitler failed his conquer with 16 members dead and he being thrown in jail for treason for 5 years. There in jail he wrote his book “mein kampf” which was about his struggle with the jews, how german people were the superior race of human, and his future plans for germany. After he got out of jail he ran for president making a nazi party. He made high energy speeches talking about his plans for germany to get back their land they lost in WWI, getting rid of the jews, and being extremely nationalist for german people. He did not become president but he had the biggest political party in germany. Hitler then got promoted to chancellor by Hindenburg. This gave him the power he needed to take germany. Hindenburg soon died and hitler promoted himself to leader which was president and chancellor wrapped into one. Hitler gained more power through the years as leader and started gathering troops. He then invaded Rhineland, the industrial capital of germany that was taken with the treaty of versailles. He captured it and started creating more military products.

	After hitler had enough armory and a big enough army he wanted to conquer Austria, but Austria surrendered and hitler took over their land. Hitler set his sights on Sudetenland and promised to the British Prime Minister that it would be his last conquer. They signed a peace agreement named the Munich agreement giving germany the land if they promised to not take any more land. Hitler agreed to this, but that wasn’t the end to his rapid conquering. He decided to disregard the agreement and conquer all of Czechoslovakia anyway. Hitler then gathered his troops to invade Poland. He quickly beat the polish army and Britain declared war on Germany. World War II had begun.
